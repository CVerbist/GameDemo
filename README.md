Game demo, a turn based combat scene for a RPG game

A very barebones combat scene. It spawns one ally and a random amount of enemies to fight. You fight by click on the hero 
and then clicking on the enemy you want to attack. It ends when you defeat all the enemies.

Use the "Build0.01.exe" in Builds to "play" the combat scene.
